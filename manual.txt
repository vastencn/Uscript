lets start by just bullet pointing the things I find I sometimes forget or need to verify

*the notation for pre-reder is "aaa  | xxx | bbb" xxx is pre-rendered

*the notation for nl cancel in defs is /n at the end of the line

*img+....   _ becomes slash.. eg "imgrender_rimg11" becomes render/rimg11.svg
imgpresave_

def uref:xxx uscript def ref, tref:xxx text def ref

scinote  example h>b1s123
scinote shortcuts 
 sci+ dec schi note (sci+123 = d>b1s123)
 sci- (sci-123 = d>b1s-123)
 scih+ hex sci note (scih+123 = h>b1s123)
 scih- (scih-123 = h>b1s-123)

atom (1 1 1) number, isotope, ion

def /n cancel proceeding newline

subarel (array sub "BOX")

_x space x px
v_x vertical space x px

ifs
if true then  = if,ify 
if false then = iff,iffy
if true 'else'  = ifn
if false 'else' = iffn

start using s[] to "call up the subvalue" to referenced (same structure as referencing an array element)

Brak execution is in rende_text.php function render_brak(&$elsa){

rinteract (1 into a ,1 from 99999)

convert (a into b int c)
convert (a into b retained c consumed d expelled e into f)
  1.a input
  2.b retained in system, c absorbed and used in conversion, d expelled as byproduct, e put ninto next step
  3.f output

  causal chars are in temporal folder, causal relationships imply a temporal nature

  I think all causal relationships will need to be cause on left, effect bon right
  unless time/entropy axis is used to define a new stype of symbol that does not portray entropy axis
  perhaps causailty should not be linked to entropy,
