lets start by just bullet pointing the things I find I sometimes forget or need to verify

*the notation for pre-reder is "aaa  | xxx | bbb" xxx is pre-rendered

*the notation for nl cancel in defs is /n at the end of the line

*img+....   _ becomes slash.. eg "imgrender_rimg11" becomes render/rimg11.svg
imgpresave_

def uref:xxx uscript def ref, tref:xxx text def ref

scinote  example h>b1s123

atom (1 1 1) number, isotope, ion

def /n cancel proceeding newline

subarel (array sub "BOX")

_x space x px
v_x vertical space x px

ifs
if true then  = if,ify 
if false then = iff,iffy
if true 'else'  = ifn
if false 'else' = iffn

start using s[] to "call up the subvalue" to referenced (same structure as referencing an array element)
