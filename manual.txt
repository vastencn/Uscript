lets start by just bullet pointing the things I find I sometimes forget or need to verify

*the notation for pre-reder is "aaa  | xxx | bbb" xxx is pre-rendered

*the notation for nl cancel in defs is /n at the end of the line

*img+....   _ becomes slash.. eg "imgrender_rimg11" becomes render/rimg11.svg
imgpresave_

def uref:xxx uscript def ref, tref:xxx text def ref
