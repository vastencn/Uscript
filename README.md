# uscript
 Uscript language generator

 Still very rough, not anywhere near release ready

if you want to check it out...

pages_index.php - the center for the current language buildout (only a small portion of the chars and structure that are already made have been added here so far, but it is growing steadily.. as steadily as I can considering lifes crazy nature hehe)

page_test.php - page building tool, where I'm building the new Uscript and developing the tool to layout pages with info and descriptiong of the language establishing steps and process

vocab.php will list words

inspectedit_test.php allows you to input text using the vocab and see it rendered and explore the existing definitions (alot of vocab and braks don't have defs yet)

presave_editor.php has some presaves that could be good examples of the Uscript markup syntax used
