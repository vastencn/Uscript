The angle symbol is essentially a cropped zoom on the angles established in the trig symbols
by first estabglishing the trig symbols for sides and angles, we can easily create a symbol that is a zoomed-in crop of an angle

we create 2 versions of the angle symbol

one is a simple crop

the other is 'simplified', we drop two protruding lines so that the symbol can be drawn more easily and elegantly
(it can be drawn with a pen without lifting the pen, its one unbroken line, just has 2 corners and an intersection)
