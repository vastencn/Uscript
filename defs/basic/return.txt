text
the return symbol is a combination of the braket and the emit 
(emit is a combination of fork and wave, with one branch fo the fork being a wave)

return is only used inside an execution braket
the Uscript return operats the same as in everyday programming

it ends the current function and returns the value proceeding it
if the prcedural pro0cess inside an executio braket hits a return. it stops
and the value of the whole braket becomes the return value
