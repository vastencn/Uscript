The sin/cos/tan braks are defined after we have already establihs the symbols for the angles and sides of right-angle tiangles

We could go into lots of 2d graphical detail defining sin/cos/tan functions
but it is so much simples to justuse SOH CAH TOA as the defintions

The function braks for sin/cos/tan incorporate a mini graph as thier "iconic element"
while not necesarry to resemble the actual graph (because defintion comes from formula)
The iconic elements are the function graph
