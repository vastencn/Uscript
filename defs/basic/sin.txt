The sin brak is defined after we have already establihs the symbols for the angles and sides of right-angle tiangles

We could go into lots of 2d graphical detail defining sin/cos/tan functions
but it is so much simples to justuse SOH CAH TOA as the defintions

The function braks for sin/cos/tan incorporate a mini graph as thier "iconic element"
while not necesarry to resemble the actual graph (because defintion comes from formula)
The iconic elements are the function graph

We defines time flow as downward, so our X/Y axis are inverted in Uscript (compared to what you are used to)
it does seem intuitve that the "time" axis is the "input" and and the "entropy" axis is the "output"
