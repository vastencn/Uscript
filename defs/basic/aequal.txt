"approximately equal to" symbol is fist defined strictly as a specific "approximation"

the examples define it as what we normally call a "rounded number"
The rounding will be the lest signnificant digit written
we round up with exactly-half
this msut be defined as it is arbitrary whether exactly half should be up or down

this mqkes it very easy to ddefine min binary
a number written to any precision
is rounded up if the next lesser bit (the bit to the right of the last bit written) is 1
x=10110.110
can be rounded to be 

x approx-equal 10011
or
x approx-equal 10011.0  (10110.1 rounded up(+0.1))
or
x approx-equal 10010.11
or 
x aprox-equal 1001 * 10^1
or 
x aprox-equal 101 * 10^2 
etc..
