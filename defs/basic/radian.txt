radians are the unit of measure for angles

easily defined with a couple examples of known angles

justifications quickly...

pretty much all fields agree radians are better than degrees

degrees are based on 365 days in a year (rotation of stars per day)
radians are based on the arc-length travelled at a radius of 1

radians are based on a unit circle and make calculations easier, rather universal
degrees are based on arbitrary factors of our planet and solar system, a very NON-universal basis
