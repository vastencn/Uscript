The symbol for addition is defined by examples
after establishing numbers it is easy to define mathematical operations through examples
Some may debate whether or not these specific examples are enough..
an arbitrary number of examples can be added to achieve full clarity.
Here I am trying to use a bare minimum simply for brevity.
Please don't "debate whether a symbol IS defined absolutely clearly without ambigity or potential misinterpretation"
I am only interested in discussions about "arguments for why a symbol is impossible define"
