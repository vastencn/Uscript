The tolerance symbol allows use to start defining tolerances and approximations

the tolerance symbol itself is just an simple +- tolerance

Visually ir a "fork and a split"/"addition and a subtraction"\

defining it is very simple with xamples like "(x=10 tol 1) = (abs(x-10) < 1)"

a tolerance of 1 allows deviation of anuything "less than 1" (.999999 yes, 1 is outside of the tolerance 1)

we call it "tolerance of" in english in this documentation
but perhaps the exact translation would be "tolerance of less than"
for brevity we just call it tolerance or tol or +-
