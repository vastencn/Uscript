the symbol for the mathematical constant "pi"
it is a circle with a line through it protruding at both ends
this looks like the symbol for "diamatere" but "poking out both sides"
i try to draw it so the protrusions could be seen as being about the same length as the circle
in other words so that the circle is only on third the height
this can be visually interpreted as "cricle 1D line is about 3x diameter" (circumference = pi * D)

the symbol is arbitrary as it is defined by a formula
its an irrational number so we just write down several digits and use the "approx equal to" instead of "equal to"
