the infinity symbol is defined as the "simplest infinity"
(mathmatecians have complicated the concept of infiity well beyond the layman defintion. some infinities are largers than others, etc..)

we define this uscript symbol (we just call it inifity here, it is not defined by its english translation)

1.while(true){x++;} return x; **increment a number forever, then check the number, it is infintiy
2.(x+x=x AND x*x=x AND x>0) = (x=infinity) **only infinity fiits the bill for x

The symbol looks like 3 "sub symbols" pointing down, so its actualy (read top to bottom) "sub ( sub( sub( ) ) )"
or in other words "contains( contains( contains() ) )"
