the "vset left" or "variable set" how we set the value of a variable
the variable is on the left and the value to set on the right

There is also the horizontally flipped "vset right" version where the variable is on right and value on the left

it is drawn as an equal symbol with an arrow through it pointing to the variable
here we are using the motion/direction meaning of the arrow
showing that the value is moved into the variable

in normal coding we use = to be a "variable set" and == to be a comparator
i assume this is because we usually set variables much more frequently than compare them
so setting varibles got the shorter version

however the original/math usage of the = symbol is not usually the "action" type menaing
so it feels more natural that the "action of setting a variable" is the one that should be different

with a few examples it is easily defined clearly
