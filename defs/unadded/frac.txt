the fraction symbol is first used to classify a symbol, not so much as a 'concept' or 'meaning'
fraction symbols are rather visually unique, even though they are just an extensions of the binary number symbols
fractions are a rather fundamental and usefull mathmatically and conceptually
so we create a symbols to refernce them as a "group"

fractions often produce irrational numbers and in uscript they are a 'solid symbol' 
so it nice to define them as a group and give them properties like order of operation
these properties are really just inherited from numbers but it is still nice to clarify

the symbol can also be usefull as a radical producing compund meaning later
