spacetime is the symbol for the concept of time and space being a 4 dimensional construct

we define it as 
3dspace * time = spacetime
4dspace sub(spacetime)

so spacetime is the product of 3d space and time, and it is a sub element of 4dspace (it is a type of 4d space)

it is drawn as a combination of
the the circle for space/zero/false to mean space
the + which is represents the time/entropy or temporal/progression element
