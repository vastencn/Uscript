array element braket

The array element brket is drawn abovbe and below, as opposed to on the sides
this is arbitrary, any modification distinguisinhes it from standard braks is acceptable
This is what was chosen and I like it...for now anyways

The identity and meaning of the array brak is established while defining the first basic array functions
sum and count braks operate on arrays, they can be used on anything
but count will return 1 or 0 unless there are array elements (because anything else is just "one big statement or formula")
and sum will just return output/result or a whole statement or formula, or a 1`/0 true false, etc..

unless there are array elements, then array functions dont produce useful results
