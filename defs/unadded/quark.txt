the quark symbol is a triangle and a dot

we introduce the triangle symbol with quarks
we use the triangle shape, an isoceles triangle with the base side horizontally flat
for quarks it poits up, anti-quarks point down

quarks obey chromodynamics, wich is a "trinary force" (if we consider electrodynamics a "binary force" of +/-)
The corners/sides will be used to represent the particles and charges

unlike other particles, which are composed of previously established radicals,
the triangle is first introduced with quarks, so its central defintions is that of chromodynamics
this means a/the primary symbolism of the trinagle the concept trinary forces

If more time was spent on geometery before moving on to physics..
then perhaps the trinagle would not feel so "centered" on chromodynamics.
But since we are "racing up the levels" thrpough math and physics towards higher level concepts
it pops up in physics

"racing up" seems appropriate
we dont want to first use up to much "unique symbols" on just math/physics
the goal is to establish a language, not just a mathemtical/scientific notation
so "racing" through and only establishing the most fundamental and necesarry concepts is the best strategy I think
This way when we reach higher level concepts we wont be complaining "all the good/simple/elegant symbols and icons are already used up"
