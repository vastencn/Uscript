the "while" brak is a 2 argument brak

the first argument is the condition
the second argument is the action

It is a sumple while loop
as long as the condition is true it will perform the action

the definition of the while brak is easy to establish
here we use several exmaples

some just use the while loop and its final state
This is enought in itself to establish a clear defintion

we also show it broken into time steps each consisting of an IF statment
This is just for further clarity
