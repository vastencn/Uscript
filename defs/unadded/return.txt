the return causes an execution brak to reduce to a value

normally exec braks just execute the procedure inside them
the return symbol acts the same as the return in our standard programming

it sends the current code, when an execution brak hits a return symbol it is halted
and the value on the right of the return symbol becaoes the "value of the exec brak"

eg

exec( a <-= 5   return a   a<-=6 )=5
*"<-=" irepresent the Uscript vset_left rymbol 

in the above example the exec brak has a value of 5 because it returns a after it is set to 5 but before it is set to 6

pass arguments into a an exec braket are done by using the "sub" braket

eg function-sub(x=1)
the format is easy to define by exmaple
the implied intuitive meaning is..
"of all possible times/ways this function is/can/will be executed, this is the sub/case/time whe x=1"

create a function with argument in the same way we normally define a function in programming,
you would just create a new brak and define it 

eg. xxxx(y,z) = exec(return y*z)
here the xxxx is just a stand in
in Uscript you would create a new grpahical symbol, aribtrary, or representitive, as long as it is unique
