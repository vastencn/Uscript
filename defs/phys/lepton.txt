Leptons are half-integer spin particles that do not undergo strong force interactions

The electron is the most iconic of these partciles

The lepton family of particles is much less massive than quarks
Leptons can display wave interference properties quite easily(realtively of course)
So they are assigned a symbol composed of the "wave" + "particle" radicals

leptons "come in 3 sizes"
the wave portion is repeated to increase the "size"

and 2 "charge types"(charged or neutral)
and the "particle/true" part becomes a "zero/space/false" to indicate a lack of charge

The symbols are simply inverted vertically to indicate the respective "anti-particle"
