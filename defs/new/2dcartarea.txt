We define this symbol to be: 
-something that has 4 right angle corners
-has two 1D perpendicular lines that can be referenced (x,y)
-something that it is equal to its X * Y

   *perpendicular is not implicit
    it is implied by the following section where all angles are right angles

this clarifies it enough to be "Cartesian area"

with this defined...
and with circular area defined easily by pi based formula...
we can abstract a general concept of area
