The greater than and less than operations rcan be used as comparators
they return the absolute value difference but if the difference is in the coresponding "direction"
if the difference is in the wrong direction it is canceld out by the defined operation

x>y is defined as 1/2 * (x-y + abs(x-y))
if x-y is negative it cancvles with abs(x-y)
if x-y is positive the it double with abs(x-y)
that sum is halved

eg.
3>2=1  6.5>3.2=3.3 7>3=4 but.. 3>7=0

since we have already defined that any value at all is TRUE and zero is FALSE
this allows it by used as a binary comparator
and also as functional operator

The firts line of formula based defintions is enough
but there are also a few exmales for added clarity
