the invert symbol is first defined quite easily as the prefix for negative numbers
it will be used later for non numeric inversions as well

the symbol is drawn as a 1D line with a "dot/particle on top" and and a "zero/space" the bottom

our normal direction of increase is "down on the page"
so placing a "particle/true" on top and "zero/space" below it on a 1D line is the reverse of our established "normal flow"
the zero should be on top and the 1 below it

up/down correlation to +/- is entirely arbitrary

There is a VERY LONG discussion(or debate/argument depending on your attitude) waiting for anyone who wants to engage the topic of arbitrary associations

there is no fundamental reason why UP should be +, or why down should be -

and because we are reading top to bottom
our "flow of direction is downward"

The world of the page is the only context that exists in Uscript
the specifics of the human experience is considered arbitrary

Down=+ up=- is not "better or correct"
it is also arbitrary with a mild rationalization of "line number increases downward"
and we establish our time arrow to point down

if anything I chose it to be contrarian so that using Uscript could be a better mental experiment on my own mind and associations

and remember, down on the page doesn't mean "down in the real world"
an intelligent being who found a Uscript key may hold the paper rotated 180 and read it bottom->top, right->left
