entropy plus
I realize the current definition is lacking clarity
Here I first focus on quickly establishing an arrow of time
With more examples both time and entropy could be clarified to an adequate degree

for now I leave it with this, knowing it is lacking
simply because I feel confident it can easily be elaborated to a point of clarity

In Uscript "entropy" simple means "in the direction of heat death"

Uscript words are NOT translations of English words. Entropy is just a rough translation of the Uscript term, its actually meaning is derived solely within Uscript, without any connection to external languages or cultures.
