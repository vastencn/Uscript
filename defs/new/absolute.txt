text
the absolute symbol forces a value to drop its sign

the symbol is drawn with particle/true above and below a zero on a 1D line
it is a rough visual representation of the concept

in the main key i originally just defined it as 
abs(x)=sqrt(x^2)
squaring then rooting a real number returns its absolute value

here there are few extra examples
these examples help calrify the operation sequence of invert and absolute when no braks are used
