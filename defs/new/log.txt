The symbol for logis defined by examples

the symbol looks like paths splittingon the top from a "3D radical"
pointing downward is split
in other words it is drawn is a "3D split"

after establishing numbers it is easy to define mathematical operations through examples

exp, root and log can also be further clarified by cross-definition
eg (x^y=z) = (z root y = x) = (z log x = y)
