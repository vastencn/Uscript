forceunit = mass
text

the force unit is os defined the same way as a newton, just with different units

a newton is 1kg m/s2 (1kg accelerated at 1 meter per 1 second in 1 second)

the uscript force unit is defined using uscript units

1 mass-unit accelerated to 1 length-unit per 1 time-unit in 1 time-unit 

remeber
mass unit=1 electron
length unit=wavelength of Hydrogen line photon
time unit is frequency of Hydrogen line photon
speed unit is pseed of light
   ***since length and time are both photon based, thus speed unit naturally works out to speed of light



so

newton = 1 kg to 1m/s in 1 s

1 Uscript force unit = 0.00000000000000000000000000091093 grams to speed of light in 0.0000000007040241 seconds
or
1 UFU = 1 electron to speed of light in 0.7040241 nano seconds

1 Newton is equal to 2577970160489 UFU

The UFU is much smaller than a newton
