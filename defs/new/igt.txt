"is greater than" is a "statement" not a "question"

(x "is greater than" y)
is defined as 
("evalute(x>y) = true")

note tha here we are establishing a case where "evalation braks" are used instead of reular braks

regular braks are just order of operation and "grouping"
eval braks return the true/false of their contents

here eval braks help define a "statement" and will later be expanded to be used for conditional logic
