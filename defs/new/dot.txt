the dot radical is used in many ways

"radix"
in math and numbers it is the radix point
( in decimal it is called the decimal point, 
radix is a more general term for any base )


"particle"
in physical it is used to represent the concept of particle
the concept of 'particle' is often relative and depends on perspective
what is a 'zero dimensional' particle from one perspective
usually turns out to0 be a multi dimensional composite if you look closer
eg. grain of sand - molecule - atom...
