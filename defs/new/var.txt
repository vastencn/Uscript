after establishing basic hexnums and math
we establish 2 categories of symbols that use the hexnums

one is "numbers" (we have not yet clarified here if they are integers, real numbers, etc..)
we will call them "ints" for now for the sake of brevity

and a class of symbols that are prefixed with the "wave" radical
"wave numbers" will be established as "variables"
the idea being that a "wave number" like "wave number 1" is an unstable or undefined number

you can think of it this way
the number potion is man ID number, instead of a letter/symbol/word like we use in math or code

"wave-number 1" is like "variable 1" or "a" 
"wave-number 2" is like "variable 2" or "b" 
etc..
