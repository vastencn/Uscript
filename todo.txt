reduce gap between num and scinote
reduce gap between some hex nums (eg 52 , 4e)
reduce gap between some hex nums and radix eg(b.d)

particle symbols(modified variable symbol)


LAZY precision on particle masses (used numbers with only 3 decimal digits precision to produce number with 5 digits hex precision)

procedual needed
   count

atom ambiguity (all isotopes of ionization state) atom(3 0 1)
  #x atom "0 isotope" y ion  	(specific isotope and ion)
  too simmilar to
  #x atom false(neg electron) y ion 	(all isotopes of spoecific ionization) atom(3 . -1)

atom braks dont link to def








-char/graphics work
arrays
procedural
circumference


-def work


-manual work
step one.. start a manual ;)

-ultra low priority(maybe do later when the important core stuff is done)
chromodynamics generator (symbols of quarks and gluons with charge)
