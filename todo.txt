*fracs of 1

char auto dims for scaled canvas
*atom brak
tabbing to abs pos
*predender def inspect
*saveable and loadable def text chunks
*def embed def
*fracs of 1-7 not full 4 bit symbol
*creat/edit presave page
finish migrating geom chars
shortcut for x/y fractions

*vertical spacer

dynamic char svg loading (option to not load svg on char load, then load svg only when char render is requested)

def text links to def
reduce gap between num and scinote
reduce gap between some hex nums (eg 52 , 4e)
reduce gap between some hex nums and radix eg(b.d)

def edit by name page (def maintence/editor ui)
click on presave not working in inpection def editor
particle symbols(modified variable symbol)


LAZY precision on particle masses (used numbers with only 3 decimal digits precision to produce number with 5 digits hex precision)

inspect edit save image

math ops page (arb_math.php)
	*rad to hex rad
	scinote to dec num
	arb hex mult
	arb hex div
	arb hex rad div
	arb hex rad mult
	Find scales for Mega,Giga,Peta,micro,nano, etc that make sense for force, speed, accel, etc
	more unit conversions
		*mass g,kg,ton,...
		*length m,km,...
		*time s, hour,day,year,...
		charge, weight, force, speed, accel, etc...


procedual needed
   *count
   *sum
   *avg
   procedural ariel ref notation(ariel means "array eleement") 
   SD brak
   foreach brak
   new symbols for "break" and "continue" and "goto+label"
   new symbols for butwise ops(extension of logical boolean ops obviously)


geom
  rotate
  perimiter
  area/volume
  start with cartesian, then add circular/spherical
 			defined by corners and angles or angles per radian
 	symbol for right angle (defined in radians and as quarter rev etc..)

atom ambiguity (all isotopes of ionization state) atom(3 0 1)
  #x atom "0 isotope" y ion  	(specific isotope and ion)
  too simmilar to
  #x atom false(neg electron) y ion 	(all isotopes of spoecific ionization) atom(3 . -1)

atom braks dont link to def






-char/graphics work
arrays
procedural
circumference


-def work
finish array ops/element defs (for the parts already added)


-manual work
keep adding to it


char database management tools
backup/restore !!!do this first and do it carefuly haha ;)
move/copy folder

-ultra low priority(maybe do later when the important core stuff is done)
chromodynamics generator (symbols of quarks and gluons with charge)
indentation based rendering groups? (currently presaves allow this, maybe better leave that way so each piece can be reused.. maybe just add better DB and sorting for presaves)
migate everyuthing to mysql? 
  (
		I think I prefer file based... 
		but.. OOOOOOHHHH how mysql would simplify so much.. 
		i started dwith files for svg file management and editing convinience
		and this still has its merits.. i can work locally on svg files and not seen to upload themn to update the db.. just edit the svg file
		so im torn.. i suppose in the end.. databasde, with an "auto update db from files" tool
