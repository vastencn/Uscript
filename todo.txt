*Current;ly working on twostack brak for interaction brack.. need leave no.. so unfnished ofr today
*
*interaction brak allows def of frame of refernce ( a interact(unitphoton, uitphoton) b  )=they exchange unit photon.. if they both recieve unit phtons, then they are in the same frame of refernce
*
*frame of refertnce allows units to be defined including the nuance of rframe()frame of refernce (there ar units for force, energy, etc acting "on" an rframe, vs the standard units of we use *for "acting within an rframe".. eg  a car, plane, spaceship, etc.. are things that "apply force to their rframe")

*Interaction next step

*add give/get(x give a to y. y gets b from x) "x | a --> b | y" get is just dir flip, <--)

*the add ability to add 2 extra params to interact, same style (2give 2get,)
* --added input x gives a1 y recievs a2, x gets b1, y sends b2 "rinteract(b1 from b2, a1 into a2 )"

vertical subcup... flexible like basic brak with image option,so it can become things like prob(x) in a nice neat single symbol style
eg._S_
	|0.5|

Page designer
twostak, vertical defmap
substract and addition are sub types of emit and absorb

javascript link function tyo hit current full url with all vars +extra url+str suffix
   -(temporary hack in defs.php render_def() $line="<a href" needs to be updated to this func when added )

pos/impos braks use basic brak[].. need fix this
	should instead use subcup/subofcup
	brak types should be better categorized and applied in more standar5d method
	sub -[  is more often used for statements like possibility
	brak[] is more often used for functions

*cause effect
*  entropy represents that systems wil tend towards x
*  so entropy axis is for increasing probabilty
*  while time axis is for guaranteed chain reaction
*	a +:  b b increases probabilty of a 
*	a :+  b a increases probabilty of b
*	a '+' b a causes b
*	a .+. b a is result of b

New Units
Force/accel have 2 types.. based on frame of reference
particle = internal to frame of refernce
space = acting on frame of refernce

particle units are speed ^2
space units are linear speed based

Ths abstracts the cirlce/space symbol to mean "frame of refernce"

In linked defs (uref,tref) addf link in def editor to go to and edit the source def

emit, absorb and interaction/exchange

...conversion brak.. in markup.php in draw_string() method just ski9sp words, need to be redone to identify proper "into"
...for now I just quickly assume "word into word into word into etc..." mlyi word elements wont work yet
!!now go back and redo again haaha
!!go back t importaing array of chu7nks split by "into"
//render the array of chunks.. forget about defmaping for now
//im at the point where I have to prioritize my time.. defmapping is a luxury for now.. where it works, good, wheere it doesnt.. so be it for now



**product brak, like sum brak (also for div, exp, etc???)


*fracs of 1

char auto dims for scaled canvas
*atom brak
tabbing to abs pos
*predender def inspect
*saveable and loadable def text chunks
*def embed def
*fracs of 1-7 not full 4 bit symbol
*creat/edit presave page
finish migrating geom chars
*shortcut for x/y fractions
*tan brak
exe() bigger dots
braks inside of conditionals dont work
*modify pi (like zhong, "3x diam")
*if brak not creating proper defmap, might need to prerender nad click off to sub def map of the brak (this will also apply to while, etc all braks based on the 2 arg if brak structure)
sd,avg,etc.. icon on def not correct (redering brak name as text word)

array def that includes properties and elements (calling properties like array elements but properties not be countable items.. maybe a separater structure for calling and listing properties.. but this seems unecesarry.. this is not actually a programming markup language.. we dont need to actually allow a procedural call to list properties because we can assume the user knows the properties..
lerning the properties is equivalant to learning the word or concept.. a learning program could be written to do thgis.. but its something on top of the language itself.. not part of ther language.. so perhaps someone writes a program where words are arrays, each conmtaining 2 elements which are arrays, an array of properties and an array of elements.. as a leaning tool.. not as part of the language itself..., the lnaguage only needs to be able to call up a property value... not loop through properties)

expand t/d measure symbols - current circle defaults to inside edge - exapnd to allow cricle on insode or outside of each vertical line akin to the shape of "d" and "b" to allow a distintiction between inside and outside edge.. for now we will just have default to inside edge because that is the mots likely to be most relevant for most situations.. especially physical space measu=remrnyt which is p[rioority right now.. empty space bwteen edges/ or distance between centers

emforce-determine if it is necesarry to break into mag force and charge force.. i thionk might not be necesarry.. moving vharge make mag feilds, mag filelds are produced by moving charges, interactions always involved both as far as i know.. and only theorhtical models of early universe(ultra high energy?) have the 2 able to act independly

redo pressure concept defintion (use relative force/pressure/area.. eg hydrolic,phematic systems like equalities)

need to establish tha liquids and gasses can also be composed of molecules - (probably jusdt establish some atomic state condition eg. liquuid at, solid at, gas at, plasma at... then also list some moleculs woith same properties)

will ned to exampnd molecule descriotion abiloity.. but dont want to use "list of atoms" style.. honestly that seems silly.. yes breif, but far too ambiguos, if anything something like dchem, or jhust dchem... still ambiguos but at least has minimnal descriptive of structure.. i would argue that atom list system is relic of past where we didnt undertsand structures..were only able to count masses and quantities.. its a relic and an oversmplified notation.. more of a naming system


add particle symbols (p1,p2,p3,p4...)

bugs:
	tref:xxx shows the tref line at end.. maybe uref does too

*vertical spacer

dynamic char svg loading (option to not load svg on char load, then load svg only when char render is requested)

def text links to def
reduce gap between num and scinote
reduce gap between some hex nums (eg 52 , 4e)
reduce gap between some hex nums and radix eg(b.d)

def edit by name page (def maintence/editor ui)
click on presave not working in inpection def editor**works for first levelpresave.. maybe depeper doesnt work
Special def for presave (shows breadown clickable render of preseave text{above the def svg/text}
particle symbols(modified variable symbol)

Tool to produce MICRO,MEGA,etc units from a starting value

add clarification that 0.1 and p1 are different (numbers that starrtt with 0. have the line protruding to the right to show the 0)


LAZY precision on particle masses (used numbers with only 3 decimal digits precision to produce number with 5 digits hex precision)

inspect edit save image

math ops page (arb_math.php)
	*rad to hex rad
	scinote to dec num
	arb hex mult
	arb hex div
	arb hex rad div
	arb hex rad mult
	Find scales for Mega,Giga,Peta,micro,nano, etc that make sense for force, speed, accel, etc
	more unit conversions
		*mass g,kg,ton,...
		*length m,km,...
		*time s, hour,day,year,...
		charge, weight, force, speed, accel, etc...


procedual needed
   *count
   *sum
   *avg
   procedural ariel ref notation(ariel means "array eleement") 
   *SD brak
   foreach brak
   new symbols for "break" and "continue" and "goto+label"
   new symbols for butwise ops(extension of logical boolean ops obviously)


geom
  rotate
  *perimiter
  area/volume
  start with cartesian, then add circular/spherical
 			defined by corners and angles or angles per radian
 	symbol for right angle (defined in radians and as quarter rev etc..)

atom ambiguity (all isotopes of ionization state) atom(3 0 1)
  #x atom "0 isotope" y ion  	(specific isotope and ion)
  too simmilar to
  #x atom false(neg electron) y ion 	(all isotopes of spoecific ionization) atom(3 . -1)

atom braks dont link to def






-char/graphics work
arrays
procedural
*circumference


-def work
finish array ops/element defs (for the parts already added)


-manual work
keep adding to it

stuff that is "optional" , left out -out but in the original, or seems like a gap but not necesarry to build the high lievel lanugage
-rogue abodies (rogue planets, etc.. dont see a need to add them again, at leats not at such an early stage.. but probably should later)



char database management tools
backup/restore !!!do this first and do it carefuly haha ;)
move/copy folder

-ultra low priority(maybe do later when the important core stuff is done)
chromodynamics generator (symbols of quarks and gluons with charge)
indentation based rendering groups? (currently presaves allow this, maybe better leave that way so each piece can be reused.. maybe just add better DB and sorting for presaves)
migate everyuthing to mysql? 
  (
		I think I prefer file based... 
		but.. OOOOOOHHHH how mysql would simplify so much.. 
		i started dwith files for svg file management and editing convinience
		and this still has its merits.. i can work locally on svg files and not seen to upload themn to update the db.. just edit the svg file
		so im torn.. i suppose in the end.. database, with an "auto update db from files" tool
	)

add ability to have if do and else do on one condition (cann just manually make images for now, not high priority)\
