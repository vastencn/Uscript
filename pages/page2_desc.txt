negative numbers, scinote usage, op sequence, int/frac/var symbols

floor, mod, round, aprox equal(a rounded number)

no bedmas, just left to right, except for scinote

could add 2d drawing style like upper exp, division stacks, root sign, etc.. not getting into that stuff now.. strictly linear bracketed for now 

will establish ints, rationals, and later irrationals.. probably stop there for 1d numbers to start, can use clauses to establish subsets of those when needed, or establish a symbol later on if actually necessary or needed for convenience

*maybe start floor round, remainder with a few examples that use simple hex number format

*show*

inv :: negative numbers
floor mod round :: floor mod round
( ( _15 v_20 ) ( _15 v_20 )) :: braks and op order (left to right. no priority based on operations type)
