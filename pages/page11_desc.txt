expression vars

expression vars hold expressions,


we ONLY define simple usage here

we do NOT address expressions containing expressions vars, or any other complex applications

Yes! introducing expression vars opens the door to a lot of questions... "how do I put the value from a variable into an expression as a fixed value instead of variable reference?" how do I build a dynamic expression then lock it down so I can now change the vars used to create it? etc..

the answer is "Those are questions for another day.. those behaviors are undefined for today"


pop loops - they popall elements and handle each. There is still a 'if true dot' on the sub brak becaus ethsi way we can add a false one to run at the end.

Pop loops are different from foreach loops, pop loops empty the original array, this means they can better represent situation when things are handle or processed. Many physical process of "take all of X and process them" convert or destroy the original source material.So this is actually a useful distinction for abstracting into language.

array sorts simple value sorts on simple 1d arrays for now
later can add bracketing and nuance to sorting

array sort exmaples

The varset arrow can connect to the bracket, can add that later

then some cool 2D webs of expression building can be constructed. even skipping the expression variables ad just pointing to where the expressions should be inserted.

add  inner-array-loop ... runs between all all the elements instead of on each element. loopvar will be empty but loopnext and loop prev will have values.

eg 
foreach ( (1,2,3)  as x ) { = x } == 3
foreach ( (1,2,3)  as x ) { += x } == 6

asteps( . . . .. _3 . . . ) :: asteps. array steps. first to last.
stepsa ( . . . .. _3 . . . ) :: stepsa. array steps last to first
 _1 :: arraysteps runs for 'gap between elements' <BR> there's no current loopvar just prev and next

sort :: array sort. small -> large , sortr :: reverse sort. large -> small

aflip :: array flip. flips order forward/backwards
