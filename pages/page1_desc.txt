some intro vague conceptuals like arrow and subset, time/entropy, dimensions

*string bin digits is all high or all low should include mark to show high/low if not clear

*maybe fill in arrow triangle to add-mass to tip

*sub example maybe clarify that all can be sub or any permutation


*numbers(hex, bin-string,tens,fractions),+-/*,exp,root,log

*maybe rotate number dots so they follow reading dir l-r t-b

*maybe modify string numbers so that the digits around the decminal are infered form position 
1_._1 = 11.11
0-.-0 = 00.00
0-\_.1= 01.11
0-.-\_= 00.01
0-\(dot in line)_1 = 00.11
etc...
