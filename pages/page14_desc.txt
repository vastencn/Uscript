add conceppt of 'perpendicular to' and then better define axis and planes
</todo>

geometry

a simple thing like pi, defined by the value, using basic math expressions we can build up so much.

a quick define that strings of solid symbols (like bin string numbers, variable, fractions) are multiplication by default.

Things left out
triangle perimeters. yes, things like herons formula can use perimeter of a triangle usefully.. but for now I'm keeping it simple and only restricting myself to the most function or fundamental. I was even reluctant to include Cartesian perimeter.

<todo>

add symbol for 'other shapes/spaces'.. just define it as 'all spaces/shapes that don't fit into any of the established categories.

also, add symbols for ellipses, etc... the geometry rabbit hole is deep and I don't want to loose myself in it right now.
maybe take the has/hasnot/isin/isnotin ops and bring them to page-1 with visual examples?</todo>
