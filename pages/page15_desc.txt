Arbitrary!
dont rant at me about why these choices are not universal.. they are NOT universal.
right vs left = completely arbitrary
up down has a bit of physical and abstract intuition. but you could easily find equally valid intuitions to argue for the opposite.


show expand on the definition of 'reverse' gaps, which look at an interval backwards invertingthe x1,x2 sequence and thus inverting the sign

inf :: infinity<br> a fused number 1 and plus symbol<br>output is looped back into an input<br>defined as { while(true){x+=1;} return x;} = infinity

apair :: apair array pairing op<br> {1 .. 2 .. 3} apair {a .. b .. c} = { {1 .. a} .. {2 .. b} .. {3 .. c} }<br> we define its behaviour "enough for now". <br>Enough to use it for basic calculus.

x :: X , y :: Y ,dx :: dx , dy :: dy
dxdy :: dx/dy. <br>change/slope of X  (vertical)<br>from perspective of one Y (horizontal) unit
dydx :: dy/dx. <br>change/slope of Y(horizontal)<br>from perspective of one X (vertical) unit

 s[ .. v1] :: the array interval gap before an element
 s[v1 .. ] :: the array interval gap after an element
 s[v1 .. v2] :: the array interval gap between two elements

x1 :: x1. first x in an interval, x2 :: x2. second x in an interval
y1 :: y1. first y in an interval, y2 :: y2. second y in an interval
