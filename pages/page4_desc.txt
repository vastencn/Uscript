next do approx equal to!

introducing real numbers, fraction and variables as categories of "numbers"

variables, or "wave-numbers" are like using a,b,c,...x,y,z as variables, except that that are wave-1, wave-2, wave-3, etc..

*show*
int frac var :: int frac and var types
wave :: wave/undefined/uncertain how vars work

absolute :: absolute, absequal :: absolute equal, != :: !=
gt lt :: > < gt/lt.by how much. not just bool
