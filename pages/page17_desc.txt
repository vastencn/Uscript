particles are defined by a chart of masses
mass units are not universal... 
... But the ratios are

electron, muon, tau, proton, neutron, and W/Z boson can alone create a chart with more than enough precision to be a universal starting point

a muon is 206.7... electrons in mass*
So the chart as a whole is universal

*many particles have some tolerances on mass certainty. electron mass is known to high order of precision and the mass units used IS electrons, everything is stated in terms of 'this â‰ˆ  x electrons of mass'.

particle symbols are composed of uscript radicals
The symbol design tries to be representative
but the definition is the mass chart

Don't confuse an attempt to make the symbol descriptive . . .
with the actual definition . . .
See this page for the chart

Leptons are wave radical combined with dot or circle
dot : true .. particle .. charge
circle : zero .. space .. false .. no charge
so charge leptons use a dot and neutral leptons use a circle.
more wave zig-zags imply 'more'(mass)

Quarks use a triangle combine with particle
The triangle shapes is used for color charge representations
The number of particles on the triangle represents charge thirds

photon is a particle inside a wave. both because a photon is more wave than particle (compared to other particles) and because antiparticles are made by flipping the particle symbol upside-down, and this way the photon doesn't change, 'because a photon is it own antiparticle'

gluon are 2 triangles connect by a wave, representing color charge interaction. the 2 triangles can be used to make color charges ( done with lines in the corners)

W and Z bosons. W boson is charge so it has a dot, Z boson neutral so it has a circle. Their most iconic interactions involve quarks, so a triangle is used. (Yes, they also interact with leptons, bur remember, these symbols are just symbols only try to representative, the definition is the mass chart and later formulas/expressions)

higgs uses a later defined symbol of 'spacetime' + wave(interaction) + circle(neutral)

Within the defintion of symbols dots mean charge and circles mean neutral

But outside of particles those symbols have broader scopes. 

Dot can me particle in general, or true, whole unit, etc..

Circle can be space, area, zero, empty, etc..

antiparticles are just described as '-' or 'invert' of a particle.

This is NOT a full proper definition of antiparticles

I just split it into the next page because this page info/ description is getting big due to the "massive symbol dump" of particles.

  _2 :: <br><br><b>FINE Hbar G and C=1</b><br>I was watching Sabine and I am finally convinced I should 'messy up' the particle mass definition chart.<br><br>electron and H21cm are observable units. chart of particles masses and then particles/properties can explain the 21cm line....<br><br>but Hbar requires first having units to discuss it(as far as I can tell).<br><br>I like introducing units with the unit standard.. It really irks me to introduce a particle mass chart without a 1 anywhere. I loved starting the chart with electron=1 and everything compared to that. and I like introducing the 21cm line and calling its time and length 1.<br><br>but...<br><br>I also REALLY liked having C=1... which it was and is.(derived from a photon so it was 1)<br><br>but it REALLY is awesome for hbar and G to also be 1.... soooo<br><br>I will either:<br><br>sacrifice the 1's in my unit establishing pages(cringe)<br><br>or<br><br>let electron mass and 21cm units be the pounds  feet and moments of uscript(cringe)<br>(a moment was 1/40th of an hour)<br><br>I do not yet know which idea makes me cringe less
