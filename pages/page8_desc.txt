foreach and execution brak

<todo>

define that when inside a loop, or anything,  varset 'into-nothing' has the function of setting a return value for the loop, or if, etc..

Seeing as I added reverse pop all loops, should probably add reverse foreach loop

loopvar symbols dont address nested loops, maybe give it a way to reference levels
I think just allow the loopvar to be treated as an array, but make a special call were you reference an array element using sci-note
eg loopvar[scinote+1] = up one nested loop level


need to add example of all the extra loopvars (next,prev,original,etc..)


</todo>


*show*
foreach( . . . as . . . .. . . .) ::  foreach( ...  ) { ... }
exe( . . . ) :: exe( ... ), return :: return
loopvar :: a symbol to stand in for variable of the current iteration
loopnext :: next loopval ,loopprev :: prev loopval
loopnext2 loopnext3 loopnext4 loopnext5 :: loopval 2 loops ahead. 3 loops ahead. 4. 5. etc..
loopprev2 loopprev3 loopprev4 loopprev5 :: loopval 2 loops back. 3 loops back. 4. 5. etc.

oloopvar _10 oloopnext oloopprev _20 oloopnext2 oloopnext3 oloopprev2 oloopprev3 :: original loop vals before the loop executed
 _2 :: original loop vals are for reference only. constant values during loop


loopcount :: loop-counter starts at one increments after each cycle

loopreturn :: the return value which can be modified when inside the loop. <br> setting this does not break the loop.<br> the return is the final value after the loop finishes.
