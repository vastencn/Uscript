tolerance
array pop
bool varsets



tolerance here means "deviation must be less than" not "deviation acceptable up to".

pops will serve well as the idea of "taking from" later

establish that a unilateral varset operation can be evaluated and check. its value is equal to resulting new value of the variable.

bool ops can be used with varset the op using the establish patterns
might need more examples, but the patter is clear i think

<todo>
**should probably add invert-array symbol(rotate-array)

**add other form of tolerance deviation up to and including)

**add examples of tolerance where numbers are drawn above or below to manipulate the upper and lower bounds independently
</todo>

5 tolerance 2 include 3.0000001 but does not include 3 or 7

all/non/etc... these benefit more form expression variables which come later

<todo>
Add defintion that declare "a larger number contains a smaller number" using has. this is the behavior if the checked input is not an array. this way it can be abstracted better into linguistic usage.
</todo>
