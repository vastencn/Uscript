those which

tolerance here means "deviation must be less than" not "deviation acceptable up to".

pops will serve well as the idea of "taking from" later

5 tolerance 2 include 3.0000001 but does not include 3 or 7

all/non/etc... these benefit more form expression variables which come later

tol :: tolerance
has( true true true  .. _5 false ) :: ... has o , isin (false .. true true true ) :: o is in ...
nhas( true true true  .. _5 false ) :: ... doesn't have o , nisin (false .. true true true ) :: o is not in ...
popa :: pop first array element, apop :: pop last array element
