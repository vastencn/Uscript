array combine
array append
array subset

<todo>
**add clearer examples here of appending to loop return to give an array result from a loop

**could do so many more array ops, but drawing the line for now 

**add count/sum/avg onto array extract for quick ops(just add small icon prefix to the box protrusion). that way you can ask "how many meet this conditon" etc..
