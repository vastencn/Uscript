array combine
array append
array subset

<todo>

finish updating subarray ops

it was split into  single result and array result

needs extra defs

and need to go through other pages to update old defs that are now wrong

update array conditional def to reflect the new updated version

the simple glyph now only extracts a single element, and the array version returns all matches

define array extract
multi element matches returns array
id reference return only the element (not encased as an array for one element)
condition extracts all that match
discard the return to just 'delete' from array

**add clearer examples here of appending to loop return to give an array result from a loop

**could do so many more array ops, but drawing the line for now 

**add count/sum/avg onto array extract for quick ops(just add small icon prefix to the box protrusion). that way you can ask "how many meet this conditon" etc..
