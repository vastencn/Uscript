Varset defined
we only define the case of a single varset per expression, and it causes both sides to be fully evaluated before the varset

weird cases are undefined for now. like multiple varsets per expression, or varsets inside of brackets. 


!!!todo 
more examples of variable setters
add a version of varset where there is a center braketed or bin sring. that means the the center value is applied to both sides (eg "v1 < sub : 3 : add > v2" = "sub 3 from v1 and add 3 to v2"  )
add expression vars

<todo>add examples where more than 2 vars are involved, a center expression that can be applied in different ways to many variable (eg value 3 can applied in different ways to many different variables with many varset arrows all originating form the same central bracket each with different operators.) *not sure if i will include that in this version

but this is definitely something to flesh out later. time time time.. so much to do, so little time.

procedural intro
variable setting, if conditionals, sequential operations

We now have varset so we can distinguish between statements of x is equal to y and instructions of set x to be y. so we don't need to rely on bracketing and subsets to show the results of variable actions.

IF evaluates the raw result of conditional

IFF (if false) inverts the conditional evaluation
yes, there is redundancy
it is a byproduct lower level design

it allows us to connect multiple outputs to a single conditional (can connect both result cases , it allows adding an else)

you can also consider it as optional ways to offer different contextual emphasis
if and iffn both do the same

<todo>
add expression vars
